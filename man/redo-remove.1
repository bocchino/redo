.SH NAME
redo-remove - remove dependency information
.SH SYNOPSIS
redo-remove [targets...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBredo-remove\fR removes all dependency information for each
of its targets.
This is useful, for example, if you generate a file \fBfoo\fR
with a do file \fBfoo.do\fR, but later decide that you want
to maintain \fBfoo\fR by hand.
In this case, \fBredo\fR remembers that \fBfoo\fR is a generated file,
so from then on it will print a warning message whenever
you run \fBredo-ifchange foo\fR (as you might want to do, if
some other file depends on the handwritten version of \fBfoo\fR).
Running \fBredo-remove foo\fR makes this warning message go away.
.SH REDO
Part of the \fBredo\fR(1) suite.
.SH CREDITS
The original concept for \fBredo\fR is due to D. J. Bernstein
(\fIhttp://cr.yp.to/redo.html\fR). Avery Pennarun created this implementation
(\fIhttp://github.com/apenwarr/redo\fR), and Rob Bocchino revised it
(\fIhttp://github.com/bocchino/redo\fR).
