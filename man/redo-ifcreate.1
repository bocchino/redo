.SH NAME
redo-ifcreate - rebuild the current target if source files are created
.SH SYNOPSIS
redo-ifcreate [sources...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Normally redo-ifcreate is run from a .do file that has been
executed by \fBredo\fR(1). See \fBredo\fR(1) for more details.
.PP
redo-ifcreate takes a list of nonexistent files (\fIsources\fR)
and adds them as dependencies to the current target (the
one calling redo-ifcreate). If any of those files are
created in the future, the target will be marked as needing
to be rebuilt.
.PP
If one of the given files exists at the time redo-ifcreate
is called, it will return a nonzero exit code.
.PP
If you want to declare dependencies on files that already
exist, use \fBredo-ifchange\fR(1) instead.
.SH REDO
Part of the \fBredo\fR(1) suite.
.SH CREDITS
The original concept for \fBredo\fR is due to D. J. Bernstein
(\fIhttp://cr.yp.to/redo.html\fR). Avery Pennarun created this implementation
(\fIhttp://github.com/apenwarr/redo\fR), and Rob Bocchino revised it
(\fIhttp://github.com/bocchino/redo\fR).
